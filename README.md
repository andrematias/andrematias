Talk about me is always hard, because I'm just a developer that is begining about 5-6 years.

Well, I'm Adré Matias, passionated for write code and learning something new where I can apply in my life.

I love automate stuffs like boring tasks on servers and routines that some machine could be done.

I like to undertand design and get some inspiration when I see some beautifull images and layouts on the web/apps.

I'm learning JavaScript more deeply nowadays with NodeJS and some frameworks like React JS, but I know PHP, Python and C. 

I'm also like to write some CSS and all base web application needs like Databases as MySQL, MongoDB and wharever I need to make some work.

I am always challenge myself.
